# NASSCOM-VSD-SoC-Design-Program
As part of the Workshop VSD SoC Design Course. 

# LAB Work
As part of the lab introduction : 

In the Process Design Kits (PDKs) the sky130A folder contains the libs.refs and lib.techs.

## libs.ref
The libs.ref contains the different process folders. In each of these process we have the library (timing corners) , lef files, spice files, mag has the cells shape, the technology lef, the verilog folder has custom defined cell definition using primitive verilog syntax.

## libs.tech

The libs.tech is the tools folder

## Hands On

### Step 1 : 

```
Command Used :
- docker
- package required openelane 0.9
```

```
prep -design picorv32a
```
When above command is ran you can see the config.tcl used for configuration, PDK's root directory, Standard cell library, LEF files and Metal layers (Only 6 layers are avialble). Then Merging lef (Cell level lef and technology level lef).

## Synthesis 

The Synthesis stage generally takes input of the design files (Verilog files), Constraints and Standard cell library (.lib) to generate the Equivalent Logic Circuit. 

Command used for yosys tool : 
```
run_synthesis
```

Results after Synthesis Step is as follows :

The Chip area of the chip is 147712.918400.
